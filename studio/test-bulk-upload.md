# Bulk Image Upload Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully implemented bulk image upload functionality for Vehicle gallery images in the Sanity Studio. Here's what was created:

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. BulkImageUploadAction Component
**File:** `studio/src/components/BulkImageUploadAction.tsx`

This component provides:
- Drag and drop interface for multiple image files
- Click to select multiple images
- Real-time upload progress indication
- Integration with Sanity's asset upload system
- Automatic addition of uploaded images to the gallery with proper metadata

### 2. Updated Vehicle Schema
**File:** `studio/src/schemaTypes/documents/vehicle.ts`

Added a new field:
- `bulkUploadHelper` - A helper field that provides the bulk upload interface
- Only visible when the gallery field exists
- Uses the custom BulkImageUploadAction component

## Features

### Bulk Upload Interface
- **Drag & Drop**: Users can drag multiple image files directly onto the upload area
- **Click to Select**: Users can click to open a file picker for multiple image selection
- **File Type Filtering**: Only accepts image files (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows upload progress and current gallery count

### Automatic Metadata Assignment
Each uploaded image is automatically configured with:
- Alt text (derived from filename)
- Default view type ("Exterior Front")
- Default tags (["exterior"])
- Default grid span settings for responsive layout
- `isBuildCoverImage` set to false (can be changed later)

### Integration with Existing Gallery
- Images are added to the existing gallery array
- Preserves all existing gallery functionality
- Works with the existing GalleryImagePreview component
- Maintains all existing field validation and structure

## Usage

1. **Navigate to a Vehicle document** in Sanity Studio
2. **Scroll to the "Bulk Upload Images" field** (appears above the Image Gallery)
3. **Click the "Bulk Upload Images" button** to open the upload dialog
4. **Drag and drop multiple images** or click to select files
5. **Wait for uploads to complete** - images will automatically appear in the gallery below
6. **Configure individual images** using the existing gallery interface

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
- Uses Sanity's `useClient` hook for asset uploads
- Integrates with Sanity's `useFormValue` to access gallery data
- Uses Sanity's `PatchEvent` system for data updates
- Implements proper error handling and loading states

### Schema Integration
- Added as a helper field to avoid conflicts with existing gallery structure
- Uses custom component input to render the bulk upload interface
- Hidden when gallery doesn't exist to prevent confusion

### Asset Management
- Uploads images directly to Sanity's asset system
- Creates proper asset references for the gallery
- Maintains all existing image metadata structure
- Preserves hotspot and other image options

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Upload multiple images at once instead of one by one
2. **User Experience**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
3. **Consistency**: Automatically applies standard metadata to all uploaded images
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing gallery functionality
5. **Flexibility**: Users can still modify individual images after bulk upload

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- TypeScript compilation (with some dependency-related warnings that don't affect functionality)
- Component structure and props
- Integration with Sanity's form system
- Asset upload functionality

The bulk upload feature is now ready for use in the Sanity Studio!
